Hailo is a Markov chatterbot inspired by [MegaHAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaHAL).

It is actually a port of the eponymous [Hailo Perl module](https://github.com/hailo/hailo).

The difference being that this one's written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/),
consists of less code, runs faster, and uses less memory. It also
drops support for multiple storage engines, sticking with SQLite only.

## Installation

First, install [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/) along
with `libsqlite3-dev`. Then do:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hailo/hailo-cr.git
cd hailo-cr
shards install
crystal build bin/hailo-cr.cr --release
```

This gives you a `hailo-cr` binary that you can run.

## Usage

Use the command line interface (`hailo-cr`), or use Hailo in your code:

```crystal
require "hailo"

hailo = Hailo.new("test.sqlite")
puts hailo.learn_and_reply("oh hi there")
```

See the [API documentation](https://hailo-cr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for more information.
